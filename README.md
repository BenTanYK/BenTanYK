## About

I'm a PhD student in the Michel research group based in the Edinburgh University School of Chemistry. 
I'm specialising in the development of physics-based methodologies (particularly free energy calculations and enhanced sampling) to aid the rational design of small-molecule therapeutics within the field of targeted protein degradation. My background is in Chemical Physics, and I am passionate about innovative simulation techniques in drug discovery.

## Projects

I am currently developing a path-based free energy calculation protocol for various Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) targeted by molecular glue degraders. This includes systems such as [BRD4-DCAF16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07089-6) and [CRBN-CK1a](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16979). By implementing Umbrella Sampling simulations within a framework based on Woo and Roux's [geometrical route](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0409005102) with [Boresch-style orientational restraints](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c01695), this allows for precise calculation of the standard binding free energy for various systems related to the ternary complex exploited by proteasomal degradation. Combining this free energy protocol with restraint-guided docking in [HADDOCK](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ja026939x) allows for structural prediction of native PPIs targetable by glues and PROTACs.
